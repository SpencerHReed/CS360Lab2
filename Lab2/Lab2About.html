			<h3>Education Experience</h3>
			<p>I am a third year Computer Science student focusing on software design</p>
			<h4>Coding Languages</h4>
			<p>As I have gone through my education I have learned multiple coding languages, such as: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>C++</li> 
				<li>C</li> 
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>HTML</li>
				<li>CSS</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These languages have been paramount in my programming journey and I continue to learn more about them and others every day. Programming is a passion of mine and one I plan on making a career out one after I obtain my Computer Science degree.</p>
			<h4>Electives</h4>
			<p>Outside of the classes related to my degree I have taken a number of <b>Psychology</b> and <b>Physical Education</b> courses. These two subjects have been of great interest to me since I was young and are ones that I enjoy learning about recreationally or as elective courses when possible</p>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
			<h4>Courtesy Clerk</h4>
			<p>My first work experience was as a Courtesy Clerk at a grocery store. At this job I learned how to manage time effectively at a job as well as how to take tasks upon myself without previous direction. I was also tasked with training new employees often near the end of my time there.</p>
			<h4>Deli Clerk</h4>
			<p>After my time as a Courtesy Clerk I moved to the deli of the supermarket and became a clerk there. In this position I learned proper food safety as well as how to be in a true customer service role</p>
			<h4>Golf Course Maintenance</h4>
			<p>The most recent job I held was on the maintenance crew on the golf course of a high end country club. </p>
			<h4>Future Plans</h4>
			<p>As the summer approaches I plan to try and find an internship at a company that will teach me how to work in the field I have chosen at university.</p>
